.SH DESCRIPTION
.B daytimed
Multi-client daemon for serving date and time information to connected clients.
Daemon should be ran with super user privileges, this is necessary since the daemon relies on setuid and setgid for privilege separation.
When connecting multiply clients make sure sufficient swap space and system-imposed fork limit are available. 
To achieve privilege separation the deamon forks a child when performing read and write operations, the fork child has its privileges downgraded by setting its UID and GID to the pseudo-user nobody.
